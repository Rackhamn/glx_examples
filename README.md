# glx_examples
My attempt at saving OpenGL, GLX &amp; X11 examples so that i dont have to google when i forget something in the API.


### Example 1:
Creates a realtime loop and an interactive X11 window.  
It initializes OpenGL and allows N triangles to be renderered to the screen.  
The loop will run for N seconds at N fps. The first triangle will spin according to time.
